# Zipf's Law 

Zipf's Law is an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics that refers to the fact that for many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences, the rank-frequency distribution is an inverse relation. 

In probability, this asserts that the frequencies ***f*** of certain events are inversely proportional to their rank ***r***. The law was originally proposed by American linguist George Kingsley Zipf (1902–50) for the frequency of usage of different words in the English language; this frequency is given approximately by $ f(r) \cong \frac{0.1}{r}$. Thus, the most common word (rank 1) in English, which is "the", occurs about one-tenth of the time in a typical text; the next most common word (rank 2), which is "of", occurs about one-twentieth of the time; and so forth.

Another way of looking at this is that a rank ***r*** word occurs ***1/r*** times as often as the most frequent word, so the rank 2 word occurs half as often as the rank 1 word, the rank 3 word one-third as often, the rank 4 word one-fourth as often, and so forth. Beyond about rank 1,000, the law completely breaks down.

The law is similar in concept, though not identical in distribution, to Benford's law.
